# Most Used Key Counter

### Setup

Inside of 'most used key counter.py' change file_path to the path of the file you want to check. Make an array following the array example, and at the bottom of the file call the mostUsedCharactersCounter() which takes 2 parameters a string of a name for the characters you are checking and then an array.

### Array Example

The array must follow the format below changing anything but the character value will break the script

```
example_array = [
    {"character": "!", "count": 0},
    {"character": "@", "count": 0},
    {"character": "#", "count": 0},
    {"character": "$", "count": 0},
    {"character": "%", "count": 0}
]
```

### Function Call Example

```
mostUsedCharactersCounter('Example Name of Characters', example_array)
```

### Extra

I have included a script to combine files it will combine any files that are put into the 'files to combine folder' the combined file will be output to the same directory 'file combiner.py' is in.
